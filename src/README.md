# evaluator
The code here doesn't run on its own, but the usage should be something along the lines of
```
from evaluator.evaluator import Evaluator
import <specific game>
game = Evaluator(<specific game>)
game.routine() -> should launch into a sandbox mode or something where you or the cpu can make moves
```
